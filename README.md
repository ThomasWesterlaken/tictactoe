# tictactoe
 a simple tick tack toe with sound
 
 ## why is this on github?
  To be honest, I spent an afternoon improving it and i'm somewhat proud of it, because this is my first ever javascript project!
 ## did I make this all by myself?
  NO! the base function with dragging and dropping was made together with [@Linksonder](https://github.com/Linksonder) !
 ## what exactly did i make?
  Anything except the grid and the ability to drag and drop! :)
 ## do you have a license for the used music?
  No! huge props to [Yurii Kohut](https://pixabay.com/users/lvymusic-27953103/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=12151)
